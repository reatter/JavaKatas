/**
 * This problem was asked by Microsoft.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an
 * integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.
 * <p>
 * 
 * For example, given the following tree:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *     *
 *    / \ 
 *   +   + 
 *  / \ / \ 
 * 3  2 4  5
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 
 * You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).
